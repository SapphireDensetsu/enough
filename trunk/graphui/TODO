* Shift+Drag should connect and not unmark multi-selection
* Persistency (Save/load)
* Feed dot with information such as text (it needs it to create proper node sizes)
* Add some nice way to use the graph backend in Python (for example, every new node creation or connection calls a callback or something)
* Labels on edges (Label drawing is commented out there, but label storing and editing is missing)
* Full keyboard control, focus changing with the mouse only is annoying!
* Play around with attributes such as color, fillcolor, etc.
* Containing subgraphs in squares (dot supports this) so you can show state groups and do state machines.

Known bugs:
* Some undo/redo bugs.

* Make the edge text appear on one side (and not change sides randomly)


=------------------------------------------------
To make sure that EdgeWidgets represent the right dot output edges, a fictive edge label can be given to dot just to identify the edge
(id(widget) for example), and it can identify back the widget. -Tplain doesn't really give you back most of the edge attributes (only label) so its going to be hard to make a .dot file that renders like us.

B. The code that handles focus and dragging/etc needs to be refactored. I don't understand what's going on in there. Calling super()._mouse_down twice is not really valid Python code, too :) I think maybe the App/Widget division should be replaced by a Widget hierarchy, but we should talk about it on the phone.
