* make sure propogation works ok in Instances, up (out) and down (in)
* decide whether changine an item's metadata is a good way to work,
   maybe we should replace it's instnace instead (especially in
   fnf_number and the like)?
* implement the editing 'stack' of entering into widgets and exiting
* BUGS:
  * when creating a new class, and then "linking" some fields, copying
   the class yields a copy where the fields are not linked. This
   happens because the editor always links the context of the current
   main widget. So to link inside a class we need to make that class
   the main widget for the time being.
  * when entering a widget (CTRL+RETURN) we should vanish away all
   other widgets. This can be done by setting visible=False to ALL
   widgets, and then making a recursive function for a InstanceWidget
   that sets visible to true.
