Requirements:
* User is exposed to one cursor
* Cursor is moved via keys determined by the containing widget
* Cursor is drawn by the containing widget, its not necessarily a
   frame

* For now cursor will be a frame
* Focus is a priority-sorted set of event receivers

* "Ordinary" Keys should be sent to the focus
* "Navigation" Keys should be sent to the parent of the focus, or to
   its parent

* observable.Join is probably a bad idea, because these separators
   should only exist for viewing purposes.

* When does an observable object die?
  * Either observers are weakrefs -- which should make everything
   disappear when it should.
  * Or explicit detachment is used (how?)

Events:
* To get reflection about key bindings, must have key registrations rather than handle_event
