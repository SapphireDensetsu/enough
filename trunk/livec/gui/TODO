* Have Widget allocate some space for its own rect

* TextEdit should take an observable mutable string, not get/set

* add the defines to the top of module

* observable.ValueProxy and use that so made child widgets can be
   replaced when they should be.

* semicolons (not as easy as it seems!)

* When does an observable object die?
  * Either observers are weakrefs -- which should make everything
   disappear when it should.
  * Or explicit detachment is used (how?)
