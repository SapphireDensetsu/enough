* replace Widget.size() method with Widget.update() recursion prior to
   the draw() recursion that updates an exposed .size attribute.

* observable.ValueProxy and use that so made child widgets can be
   replaced when they should be.

* add_observer to take an arg and have infrastructure to call the
   observe_methods with the arg instead of "self". Allow specifying a
   prefix too perhaps?

* When does an observable object die?
  * Either observers are weakrefs -- which should make everything
   disappear when it should.
  * Or explicit detachment is used (how?)

Events:
* To get reflection about key bindings, must have key registrations rather than handle_event
