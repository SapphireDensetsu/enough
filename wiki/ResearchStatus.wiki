#summary Research goals and status.

= Goals =
The current research goals are, in possible chronological order:
 * Research how the various BuzzWords can come together, using Subtext as a main resource. Current work is in ObjectModel.
 * Read more of the related material (from Subtext(and source code)/EROS/Coyotos/BitC and E, especially)
 * Look for new concepts by finding more published material or related projects

== Old/completed goals ==
 * Formulate/describe each of the BuzzWords and add new ones - looks like we covered most of what we can think of for now
