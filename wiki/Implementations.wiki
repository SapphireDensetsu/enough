== Tools ==
 * *videowriter* is a tiny program for *creating a video out of a sequence of images*. Available in the SVN under tools. *Requires*: OpenCV library. Or you can try the [http://enough.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tools/video_writer linux binary].

=== Some stuff that may be useful ===
This includes even trivial stuff that we haven't seen in many other places.
 * *Bezier curves in Python* - the Graphui gui includes an implementation of n-order bezier curves in Python. See the file Bezier.py under graphui/Lib in the svn trunk.
