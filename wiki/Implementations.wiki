== NF ==
NF is a gui for live programming. Still waiting for a first release.

== Graphui ==
Graphui (pronounced grafoo-ee) is an attempt at a generic graph editing gui. There is a *[http://enough.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/media/graphui_sneak1.avi sneak preview]* available. The code is in the svn under graphui.

Here are the current "features":
 * Cross-platform - tested on Linux (ubuntu) and Windows
 * Connect, disconnect, add and remove nodes, zoom in & out
 * Automatic layout using [http://www.graphviz.org Dot, Neato & Twopi] (Graphviz). You can switch layout engines in real time.
 * Animation between layouts 
 * Undo/redo
 * Multi-line text labels for nodes
 * Record animation - makes a series of BMP files you can later turn into a movie using videowriter or some other tool.

More coming soon!

*Requirements*: [http://www.python.org Python] 2.5, [http://www.pygame.org Pygame], [http://www.twistedmatrix.com Twisted], and [http://www.graphviz.org Graphviz] (aka dot).

Here are two screenshots, first using DOT layout, second using NEATO:

== Tools ==
 * *videowriter* is a tiny program for *creating a video out of a sequence of images*. Available in the SVN under tools. *Requires*: OpenCV library. Or you can try the [http://enough.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tools/video_writer linux binary].

=== Some stuff that may be useful ===
This includes even trivial stuff that we haven't seen in many other places.
 * *Bezier curves in Python* - the Graphui gui includes an implementation of n-order bezier curves in Python. See the file Bezier.py under graphui/Lib in the svn trunk.
