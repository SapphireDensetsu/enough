= Introduction =
Before we start, it is recommended to read about [SyntaxAndSemantics Syntax and Semantics].

== Limitations of syntax ==
The external relation between syntax and meaning has a price. Sometimes the syntax imposes restrictions that the semantics don't, therefore causing us to think of things in a more restricted way. A language with this problem is not a good language. We define both syntax _and_ semantics as part of the language, and expect them to match.
