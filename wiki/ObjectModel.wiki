This is heavily based on the work of Jonathan Edwards (See [www.subtextual.org Subtext]). The majority of the ideas presented here are actually directly taken from Edwards' work in Subtext (with some modifications).

= Introduction =

There is an inherent complexity in the relationship between side-effects and immutable functions. In the following we describe a possible way to reconcile these two conflicting terms and also try to deal with related issues. This document represents the core of our understanding of how the new computing world should function.

= Terminology =

 * *Reference*: A universal link to a value, mutable or function.
 * *Value*: An immutable thing like an integer or a string - these exist "out of" the computer, and will never change.
 * *Function*: Transform values into new values, in a side-effect free way.
 * *Mutable*: Typically a container, but can also be "built-in" (i.e implemented via a lower-level mechanism, e.g console).
 * *Action*: Modify a Mutable or use other Actions.
 * *Event*: Triggered when a Mutable modification or built-in event occurred, and can be used to invoke Actions.
