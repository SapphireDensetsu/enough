#summary A library for enough projects
#labels InProgress

= Outline =

 * *Purpose:* to allow development of enough projects (e.g. LiveC, Graphui) using a design based on ideas in Enough.
 * *Design:* Currently, the library's design reflects:
   * [DifferentialComputing differential computing] using deltas and observation
   * [LazyEvaluation Lazy Evaluation] using observation
   * [ObjectRevisionControl Object-based revision control] using deltas, histories, and hierarchical baselines. 
   * [RetroactiveMacros Retroactive macros] using a set of WithDelta's

 * *Future features* that may be trivial after we complete this phase:
   * [MemoryManagement Intelligent memory management (recomputability)]
   * [OrthogonalPersistence Orthogonal persistence]
   * [AdaptiveProfiling Adaptive profiling]

== Layer 1: Observable objects with deltas ==
A few definitions:
 * *Observable*: an object that sends notifications when it is changed (mutated). Some observable types are:
    * `List` (notifies when items are added, removed or replaced)
    * `Dict` (notifies when keys are added, removed or a value is replaced)
    * `ValueContainer` (notifies when its pythonic value changes)
 * *Observer*: an entity that is registered to receive notifications about changes in an observable object.
 * *Delta*: represents a change in an object (e.g. `ListItemAdd` represents the adding of an item to a list). Deltas do not refer to a specific object that has changed - they only represent the change that can be applied to an object. Each object type (`List`, `Dict`, etc.) has its own set of deltas classes specific to that type.
    * *Notifications* of observable objects are actually deltas. When a change occurs, an observable sends a delta describing the change to the observers.
 * *Expression*: a "computable" that can be thought of as a function: `Expression -> Expression` that maps input expressions to output expressions. Note that the expression doesn't have an "output" really, the expression object itself is the output. An expression may have no input (see `Literal` below). Some important expressions are:
   * `Literal` - the expression that simply represents a value
   * `WithDelta` - given a pair (expression, delta), a `WithDelta` represents a revision of an object. The expression input to `WithDelta` is basically a "base revision", and the output (i.e. the `WithDelta` object itself) is the "new revision", which is equal to "base revision" + delta.
