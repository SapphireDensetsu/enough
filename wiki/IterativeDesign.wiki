#summary About iterative design methodology

= What is it? =

_Iterative design_ is a methodology for producing a well structured system, with the assumption that a good design can never be invented in one shot.

Design work is done in succesive iterations, where each time the design is analyzed and re-constructed using all the lessons learnt from the previous attempts.

== So what? ==
This is *not new* or special, but when stated clearly in advance it allows us to set realistic goals and to acheive them, without any real compromise. However, in many cases (especially in industry) results in time are the only measure of success, and the method is to create the best possible design in a single attempt, during "Design Time". After design time it is very hard to change the design and any problems found later can cause much distress.

Another common problem is using iterative methodologies without stating it clearly. This can lead to a regression into more primitive, non-iterative methods, after a long time. The eventual result is that the design process stops.

= Summary =
We want to use iterative methods for design and implementation because our project aims to explore different directions but also to achieve real results.
