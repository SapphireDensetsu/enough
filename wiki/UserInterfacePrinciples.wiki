#summary User interface principles

= Introduction =

Some general principles that should guide UI design.


= Details =

1. Properly use the screen real-estate

Avoid overlapping windows (Very stupid use of pixels) - it is always possible to better arrange the pixels than overlapping windows.

2. Display output as soon as possible

  2a. Dependence

    If the output does not depend on some input, DO NOT wait for that input to display the output.  Example: A question such as "Should I save the password you just entered?" should not delay the login itself.

  2b. Defaults
    If the output does depend on some input, but the action that generates the output is not harmfully irreversible, and there is a sensible or likely default to use as a possible input, try to use that default and display output as soon as possible.
This may also increase the user's understanding of how the output depends on the input.

TODO: Explain more thoroughly.
