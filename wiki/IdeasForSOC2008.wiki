= Basic requirements for student applicants =
We need people with the following experience:
  * Good knowledge of Python - a basic requirement.
    * Experience with [http://www.pygame.org pygame] - helpful but not essential
  * Ability to dive into Enough's design and critical thinking
  * Experience with functional languages (especially Haskell) is very welcome
  * Experience in developing a programming language - the more abstract the better 

= LiveC =
We need to re-implement the live C programming environment after the re-design that we recently did. This involves learning the design, the enough package library, and using the tracer to implement a high-performance environment for live C.

= Graphui =
Graphui is the generic graph gui (GraphViz/dot GUI). We need to re-implement Graphui after the re-design of the enough package library.

= Haskell =
As a research assignment, we need to study Haskell and analyze our design with the accumulated knowledge.

= Python Tracer =
The tracer needs a better gui. See http://pythontracer.googlecode.com.

This sub-project needs two things:
  # Developing the tracer, which requires:
    * Deep knowledge of Python and how CPython works.
    * Good experience in C
  # Developing the GUI, which requires:
    * Experience developing GUI with Python
