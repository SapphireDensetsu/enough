#summary Ideas for Google Summer of Code 2008

= LiveC =
We need to re-implement the live C programming environment after the re-design that we recently did. This involves learning the design, the enough package library, and using the tracer to implement a high-performance environment for live C.

= Graphui =
Graphui is the generic graph gui (GraphViz/dot GUI). We need to re-implement Graphui after the re-design of the enough package library.

= Haskell =
As a research assignment, we need to study Haskell and analyze our design with the accumulated knowledge.

= Python Tracer =
The tracer needs a better gui. See http://pythontracer.googlecode.com
