#summary Various contemplations about programming

= Goals and structure of programming languages =
When trying to revolutionize programming, it is best to keep in mind its goals.

Some points:
 * A programming language should allow the most natural (easy to express and understand) description of the system.
 * For a general description of a system, natural language is the easiest to understand but lacks the exactness required for a program.
 * A system can be described in many different ways, and the best way is the one that is easiest for the programmer to use.
 * As humans we usually describe our tasks in an object oriented and procedural way. For example, to tie shoe laces one could use the following instructions:
  * Put the shoe on your foot (the verb "put" is a method of you - an object, shoe is another object, and your foot is a third object).
  * Grab the laces with your hands
  * etc.
 * As humans we don't normally describe our actions in functional terms. We think of a car (a very complex system) as an object with parts, states and capabilities. We don't think of a car as set of highly-complex functions.
 * Functional programming is easy for the computer to "understand", reasons including the fact that side effects are concentrated in specific points.
