# Basic requirements for student applicants #
We need people with the following experience:
  * Good knowledge of Python - a basic requirement. Experience with CPython (Python internals) - even better.
    * Experience with [pygame](http://www.pygame.org) - helpful but not essential
  * Good knowledge of computer system architecture, familiarization with a kernel
  * Experience with C and C++
  * Ability to dive into Enough's design and critical thinking

Nice to have:
  * Experience with functional languages (especially Haskell) is very welcome
  * Experience in developing programming languages - the more abstract the better

# OCaPy - Object Capability Python Fork #
Developing a Python fork that uses object capabilities rather than ambient authority. [See here for details](OCaPy.md).

# Python Tracer #
The tracer needs a better gui. See http://pythontracer.googlecode.com.

This sub-project needs two things:
  1. Developing the tracer, which requires:
    * Deep knowledge of Python and how CPython works.
    * Good experience in C
  1. Developing the GUI, which requires:
    * Experience developing GUI with Python

# LiveC #
We need to re-implement the live C programming environment after the re-design that we recently did. This involves learning the design, the enough package library, and using the tracer to implement a high-performance environment for live C.

# Graphui #
[Graphui](Graphui.md) is the generic graph gui (GraphViz/dot GUI). We need to re-implement Graphui after the re-design of the enough package library.


# Haskell #
As a research assignment, we need a Haskell expert to analyze our design and comment on similarties or additional ideas from Haskell.
