* Shift+Drag should connect and not unmark multi-selection
* Persistency (Save/load)
* Feed dot with information such as text (it needs it to create proper node sizes)
* Add some nice way to use the graph backend in Python (for example, every new node creation or connection calls a callback or something)
* Labels on edges (Label drawing is commented out there, but label storing and editing is missing)
* Full keyboard control, focus changing with the mouse only is annoying!
* Play around with attributes such as color, fillcolor, etc.
* Containing subgraphs in squares (dot supports this) so you can show state groups and do state machines.

Known bugs:
* Some undo/redo bugs.
