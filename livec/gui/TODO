* Have Widget allocate some space for its own rect

* TextEdit should take an observable mutable string, not get/set

* add the defines to the top of module

* observable.ValueProxy and use that so made child widgets can be
   replaced when they should be.
* How to manage UNDOs?

* semicolons (not as easy as it seems!)

* When does an observable object die?
  * Either observers are weakrefs -- which should make everything
   disappear when it should.
  * Or explicit detachment is used (how?)

BUGS:
* Building all the widgets for the model is taking way too long
* Box supports parenting mode even when no children, and only in parenting
   mode you can add stuff to the box (cause there's an insert pos) but
   its not visually appearant that box is in parenting mode. Maybe
   parenting mode when no children should show the box as selected?
