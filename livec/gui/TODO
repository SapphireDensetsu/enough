* List->ObservableList?
* Start without events.
* Start with only draw that allocates display space bottom-up.
* GUI does not contain any state that's redundant to the model,
   adapter functions/callbacks are always used.
* GUI is allowed to contain extra state that is not redundant to the
   model.

Events:
* To get reflection about key bindings, must have key registrations rather than handle_event
