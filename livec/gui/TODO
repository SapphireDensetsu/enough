A. Keymaps

A keymap should contain:
* Existing specific key mappings
* Mappings of groups to funcs

Groups must now conflict with specific key mappings of the same
   keymap.
Groups are observed as a key.

Now currently Keymap exposes itself as an observable dict.
I think that it should expose that still, but it should also expose
   group keys.

It should disallow conflicts between the specific keys and the group
   keys.


* Have Widget allocate some space for its own rect

* TextEdit should take an observable mutable string, not get/set

* add the defines to the top of module

* observable.ValueProxy and use that so made child widgets can be
   replaced when they should be.
* How to manage UNDOs?

* semicolons (not as easy as it seems!)

* When does an observable object die?
  * Either observers are weakrefs -- which should make everything
   disappear when it should.
  * Or explicit detachment is used (how?)
