* observers suck! :-(
  * To fix namespace collision, can add prefix
  * To observe just what you want to, can create notifiers/observables
   rather than inherit them.

* observable.ValueProxy and use that so made child widgets can be
   replaced when they should be.

* add the defines to the top of module

* semicolons (not as easy as it seems!)

* add_observer to take an arg and have infrastructure to call the
   observe_methods with the arg instead of "self". Allow specifying a
   prefix too perhaps?

* When does an observable object die?
  * Either observers are weakrefs -- which should make everything
   disappear when it should.
  * Or explicit detachment is used (how?)

Events:
* To get reflection about key bindings, must have key registrations rather than handle_event
