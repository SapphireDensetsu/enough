* Have Widget allocate some space for its own rect

* TextEdit should take an observable mutable string, not get/set

* add the declarations to the top of module widget:
  * emphasize them when stuff using them is in focus
  * option to remove them

* Configuration management? Where to save it? load it?

* figure out how to expose where a node is coming from (stack: int
   argc, global: bleh)

* observable.ValueProxy and use that so made child widgets can be
   replaced when they should be.

* How to manage UNDOs?

* Widgets should have a destroy?

* When does an observable object die?
  * Either observers are weakrefs -- which should make everything
   disappear when it should.
  * Or explicit detachment is used (how?)

BUGS:
* Building all the widgets for the model is taking way too long
