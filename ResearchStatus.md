# Current Goals #
  * Design and implement an integrated revision-controlled, observability library, and use it for LiveC.

## Perpetual goals ##
  * Research how the various BuzzWords can come together in a elegant way.

## Old/completed goals ##
  * Formulate/describe each of the BuzzWords and add new ones - looks like we covered most of what we can think of for now
